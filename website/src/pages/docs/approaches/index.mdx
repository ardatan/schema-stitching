# Overview of Approaches

There are many ways of stitching different GraphQL services based on the way of configuring the services.
It can be either on the gateway or service level.

## Schema Extensions (gateway-level configuration)

In this approach, you merge different subschemas and extend the unified schema by adding additional fields delegating to the other subschemas;

```graphql filename="author-service.graphql"
type Query {
  author(id: ID!): Author
}

type Author {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
}
```

And the book service;

```graphql filename="book-service.graphql"
type Query {
  book(id: ID!): Book
}

type Book {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  authorId: ID!
}
```

Then in the gateway, you can extend `Book` type with a new field called `author` that delegates to the author service;

```graphql
extend type Book {
  author: Author!
}
```

```ts
export const resolvers = {
  Book: {
    selectionSet: /* GraphQL */ `
      {
        authorId
      }
    `,
    resolve: ({ authorId }) =>
      delegateToSchema({
        schema: authorSubschema,
        fieldName: 'author',
        args: {
          id: authorId
        }
      })
  }
}
```

## Programmatic Type Merging (gateway-level configuration)

Type Merging is another approach in Schema Stitching that allows you merge different type definitions from different services referring to the same entity.
This is useful if you have different standalone GraphQL APIs and you need to configure those in the gateway level

```graphql filename="author-service.graphql"
type Query {
  author(id: ID!): Author
}

type Author {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
}
```

```graphql filename="book-service.graphql"
type Query {
  book(id: ID!): Book
  authorWithBooks(id: ID!): Author
}

type Book {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  author: Author!
}

type Author {
  id: ID!
  books: [Book]
}
```

You can see there are two different `Author` types sharing the same entity;

```ts
const gatewaySchema = stitchSchemas({
  subschemas: [
    {
      schema: authorSchema,
      merge: {
        Author: {
          fieldName: 'author',
          selectionSet: '{ id }',
          args: originalObject => ({ id: originalObject.id })
        }
      }
    },
    {
      schema: bookSchema,
      merge: {
        Author: {
          fieldName: 'authorWithBooks',
          selectionSet: '{ id }',
          args: originalObject => ({ id: originalObject.id })
        }
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

Then when you make the following request;

```graphql
{
  author(id: 1) {
    # From Author Service
    id
    name # From Author Service
    books {
      # From Book Service
      id
      title
    }
  }
  book(id: 2) {
    # From Book Service
    id
    title # From Book Service
    author {
      # From Book Service
      id
      name # From Author Service
    }
  }
}
```

## Directives-based Type Merging (service level configuration)

If you want to avoid configuring the services in the gateway but in the services level, you can use directives-based approach which is similar to Apollo Federation.

Schema Stitching allows you to use stitching directives or Apollo Federation specification to implement your services.

This is the only one can be considered as an alternative to Apollo Federation because Apollo Federation implements a type merging gateway based on directives instead of programmatic API or schema extensions.

Stitching Directives are more flexible compared to Apollo Federation so you can still follow the regular GraphQL resolver signature instead of non-standard ones like `__resolveEntity` etc.

The following example is identical to the one above;

```graphql filename="author-service.graphql"
type Query {
  author(id: ID!): Author @merge
}

type Author {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
}
```

```graphql filename="book-service.graphql"
type Query {
  book(id: ID!): Book @merge
  authorWithBooks(id: ID!): Author @merge
}

type Book @key(selectionSet: "{ id }") {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  author: Author
}

type Author @key(selectionSet: "{ id }") {
  id: ID!
  books: [Book]
}
```
