# Filtering

Filter transforms are constructed with a filter function that returns a boolean. The transform
executes the filter on each schema element within its scope and rejects elements that do not pass
the filter.

## Filtering Types

You can filter any named element types based on the given filter function;

```ts
class FilterTypes(filterTypeFn: FilterTypeFn) implements Transform

type FilterTypeFn = (type: GraphQLNamedType) => boolean
```

The following transform definition removes all types ending with `_Secret` from the schema;

```ts
import { FilterTypes } from '@graphql-tools/wrap'

const subschema = {
  schema,
  executor,
  transforms: [new FilterType(namedType => !namedType.endsWith('_Secret'))]
}
```

## Filtering Root Fields

You can filter the fields of the root types such as Query, Mutation, and Subscription based on the
given filter function;

```ts
class FilterRootFields(filterRootFieldFn: FilterRootFieldFn) implements Transform

type FilterRootFieldFn = (operation: 'Query' | 'Mutation' | 'Subscription', fieldName: string, fieldConfig: GraphQLFieldConfig<any, any>) => boolean
```

The following transform definition removes all fields starting with `_secret` from the schema;

```ts
import { FilterRootFields } from '@graphql-tools/wrap'

const subschema = {
  schema,
  executor,
  transforms: [
    new FilterRootFields((operation, fieldName, fieldConfig) => !fieldName.startsWith('_secret'))
  ]
}
```

## Filtering Object, Interface or Input Object Fields

You can filter the fields of object types based on the given filter function;

```ts
class FilterObjectFields(filterObjectFieldFn: FilterObjectInterfaceFieldFn) implements Transform
class FilterInterfaceFields(filterInterfaceFieldFn: FilterObjectInterfaceFieldFn) implements Transform

type FilterObjectInterfaceFieldFn = (typeName: string, fieldName: string, fieldConfig: GraphQLFieldConfig<any, any>) => boolean
```

```ts
class FilterInputObjectFields(filterInputObjectFieldFn: FilterInputObjectFieldFn) implements Transform

type FilterInputObjectFieldFn = (typeName: string, fieldName: string, fieldConfig: GraphQLInputFieldConfig) => boolean
```

The following transform definition removes all interface fields starting with `_secret` from the
schema;

```ts
import { FilterInterfaceFields } from '@graphql-tools/wrap'

const subschema = {
  schema,
  executor,
  transforms: [
    new FilterInterfaceFields(
      (typeName, fieldName, fieldConfig) => !fieldName.startsWith('_secret')
    )
  ]
}
```

## Filtering Object Field Directives

You can filter the directives of object fields based on the given filter function;

```ts
class FilterObjectFieldDirectives(filterObjectFieldDirectiveFn: FilterObjectFieldDirectiveFn) implements Transform

type FilterObjectFieldDirectiveFn = (directiveName: string, directiveValue: any) => boolean
```

The following transform definition removes all directives unless the directive name is `keep` and
the directive argument `arg` is not `1`;

```ts
import { FilterObjectFieldDirectives } from '@graphql-tools/wrap'

const schema = buildSchema(/* GraphQL */ `
  directive @remove on FIELD_DEFINITION
  directive @keep(arg: Int) on FIELD_DEFINITION
  type Query {
    alpha: String @remove
    bravo: String @keep
    charlie: String @keep(arg: 1)
    delta: String @keep(arg: 2)
  }
`)

const subschema = {
  schema,
  transforms: [
    new FilterObjectFieldDirectives(
      (dirName: string, dirValue: any) => dirName === 'keep' && dirValue.arg !== 1
    )
  ]
}
```

So the resulting schema will be;

```graphql
type Query {
  alpha: String
  bravo: String @keep
  charlie: String
  delta: String @keep(arg: 2)
}
```
