# Mutations &amp; subscriptions

This example explores stitching mutation and subscription services into a combined gateway schema, as discussed in [stitching remote schemas](/docs/getting-started/remote-subschemas) documentation.

**This example demonstrates:**

- Adding a remote mutation service.
- Adding a remote subscription service.
- Adding a subscription proxy.

The following services are available for interactive queries:

- **Stitched gateway:** http://localhost:4000/graphql
- _Posts subservice_: http://localhost:4001/graphql
- _Users subservice_: http://localhost:4002/graphql

## Summary

This example incorporates queries, mutations, subscriptions, and previews how a type can be merged across services.

### Queries

Run the following query to see all posts that have been created; the results will be empty to start with:

```graphql
query {
  posts {
    id
    message
    user {
      username
      email
    }
  }
}
```

All gateway query operations proxy a remote service using the `executor` function in subschema config.

### Mutations

Mutations are virtually identical to queries, but with the expressed intent of modifying data on a remote server. They use a different GraphQL operation name ("mutation") to assure that they're not intermixed with queries. Try opening a new tab in the GraphQL Playground UI and running the following mutation:

```graphql
mutation {
  createPost(message: "hello world") {
    id
    message
    user {
      username
      email
    }
  }
}
```

Rerunning the query above, you'll see there are now posts. This mutation creates in-memory records in the Posts service (the records will be reset each time the server restarts). The results of a mutation are resolved just like any other typed object, so may resolve all of the same data as a query&mdash;including a randomly assigned a `User` association that comes from the Users service (the process for which is discussed in [chapter three](#)).

Like queries, all gateway mutation operations proxy a remote service using the `executor` function in subschema config.

### Subscriptions

Subscriptions pull live GraphQL updates over an open HTTP connection. Try opening another tab in the GraphiQL UI and running the following subscription:

```graphql
subscription {
  newPost {
    id
    message
    user {
      id
      username
      email
    }
  }
}
```

Nothing happens aside from a load spinner appearing&mdash;however you have an open socket connection that is waiting to recieve data. Now try running the above mutation a few more times and then check back in on your subscription. The subscription will receive a live push of data each time a mutation publishes an update. Again, the results of a subscription are resolved just like any other typed object, so may resolve all of the same data as a query&mdash;including data merged from across services.

### Few notes about the subscriptions setup

- You can check [Executors](/docs/getting-started/remote-subschemas#executors) section to learn more about how to configure your executor to support your subscription setup, because Schema Stitching doesn't care if you use WebSockets, Server-Sent Events, or any other transport mechanism.
- This example uses GraphQL Yoga's [Server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events) approach for subscriptions which doesn't need any extra configuration with the http executor since SSE also uses HTTP.
- You can see [GraphQL Yoga's Subscriptions](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/yoga-server/docs/features/subscriptions) documentation to learn more about how it handles subscriptions.
