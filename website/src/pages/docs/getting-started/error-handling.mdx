# Error Handling

Whether you're [merging types](/docs/approaches/type-merging), using
[schema extensions](/docs/approaches/schema-extensions), or simply combining schemas, any errors
returned by a subschema will flow through the stitching process and report at their mapped output
positions. It's fairly seamless to provide quality errors from a stitched schema by following some
basic guidelines:

1. **Report errors!** Having a subschema return `null` without an error for missing or failed
   records is a poor development experience, to begin with. This omission will compound should an
   unexpected value produce a misleading failure in gateway stitching. Reporting
   [proper GraphQL errors](https://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Errors) will contextualize
   failures in subschemas, and by extension, within the stitched schema.

1. **Map errors to array positions**. When returning arrays of records (a common pattern while
   [batch loading](/docs/approaches/type-merging#batching)), make sure to return errors for specific
   array positions rather than erroring out the entire array. For example, an array should be
   resolved as:

```js
posts() {
  return [
    { id: '1', ... },
    new GraphQLError('Record not found', {
      extensions: {
        code: 'NOT_FOUND',
      },
    }),
    { id: '3', ... }
  ];
}
```

1. **Assure valid error paths**. The
   [GraphQL errors spec](https://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Errors) prescribes a `path`
   attribute mapping an error to its corresponding document position. Stitching uses these paths to
   remap subschema errors into the combined result. While GraphQL libraries should automatically
   configure this `path` for you, the accuracy
   [may vary by programming language](https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby/issues/3193).
