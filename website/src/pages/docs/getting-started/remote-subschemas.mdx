# Remote Subschemas

Remote subschemas are the objects containing a non-executable `GraphQLSchema` instance and an `Executor` function that takes an object including the details for a GraphQL request.
Usually this executor is a function that uses HTTP to receive an `ExecutionResult` from the service.

## Configuring Subschemas

In the example above, the extra "subschema" wrapper objects may look verbose at first glance, but they are basic implementations of the `SubschemaConfig` interface that accepts several additional settings (discussed throughout this guide):

```ts
export interface SubschemaConfig {
  schema: GraphQLSchema
  executor?: Executor
  createProxyingResolver?: CreateProxyingResolverFn
  rootValue?: Record<string, any>
  transforms?: Array<Transform>
  merge?: Record<string, MergedTypeConfig>
  batch?: boolean
  batchingOptions?: {
    extensionsReducer?: (mergedExtensions: Record<string, any>, request: Request) => Record<string, any>
    dataLoaderOptions?: DataLoader.Options<K, V, C>
  }
}
```

Subschema config should _directly_ provide as many settings as possible to avoid unnecessary layers of delegation. For example, while we _could_ pre-wrap a subschema with transforms and a remote executor, that would be far less efficient than providing the `schema`, `transforms`, and `executor` options directly to subschema config.

Also note that these subschema config objects may need to be referenced again in other stitching contexts, such as [schema extensions](/docs/approaches/schema-extensions). With that in mind, you may want to export your subschema configs from their module(s).

### Remote Subschemas via HTTP

To include a remote schema in the combined gateway, you must provide at least the `schema` and `executor` subschema config options.

```js
import { introspectSchema } from '@graphql-tools/wrap'
import { buildHTTPExecutor } from '@graphql-tools/executor-http'

const remoteExecutor = buildHTTPExecutor({
  endpoint: 'https://my.remote.service/graphql'
})

export const postsSubschema = {
  schema: await introspectSchema(remoteExecutor),
  executor: remoteExecutor
}
```

- `schema`: this is a non-executable schema representing the remote API. The remote schema may be obtained using [introspection](#introspecting-schemas-using-executors), or fetched as a flat SDL string (from a server or repo) and built into a schema using [`buildSchema`](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/utilities/#buildschema). Note that not all GraphQL servers enable introspection, and those that do will not include custom directives.
- `executor`: is a generic method that performs requests to a remote schema. It's quite simple to [write your own](#executors). Subschema config uses the executor for query and mutation operations. See [handbook example](/docs/handbook/combining-local-and-remote-schemas).

## Executors

You can use ready-to-use executors from GraphQL Tools or write your own.

### HTTP Executor (`@graphql-tools/executor-http`)

This package allows you to create an executor for your HTTP service.

- [GraphQL over HTTP protocol](https://graphql.github.io/graphql-over-http/) for queries and mutations
- [Server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events) as a response type for subscriptions just like [GraphQL Yoga](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/yoga-server/docs/features/subscriptions#quick-start-with-simple-server-sent-events-sse) implementing it
- [GraphQL over Server-Sent Events protocol](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-sse/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md) for subscriptions in a distinct connection mode.
- [GraphQL multipart request specification](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec) for file uploads and all other types of multipart requests
- [RFC: GraphQL Defer and Stream Directives](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/rfcs/DeferStream.md) for incremental delivery
- Different fetch strategies like `timeout` and `retry`

```ts
import { buildHTTPExecutor } from '@graphql-tools/executor-http';

const executor = buildHTTPExecutor({
    endpoint: 'http://localhost:4001/graphql',
    // optional and default is false
    useGETForQueries: false,
    // optional
    headers: {
        'authorization': 'Bearer MY-TOKEN'
    },
    // optional and default is POST
    method: 'POST'
    // Timeout and default is Infinity
    timeout: Infinity
    // Request Credentials (default: 'same-origin') [Learn more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/credentials)
    credentials: 'same-origin',
    // Retry attempts on fail and default is 0
    retry: 0
})
```

#### Dynamic Headers and Endpoint URL

It is possible to change headers and endpoint URL dynamically. HTTP executor respects `extensions` object passed in the request.

```ts
executor({
  document: parse(/* GraphQL */ `
    {
      me {
        id
        username
        name
      }
    }
  `),
  extensions: {
    headers: {
      Authorization: 'my-token'
    },
    endpoint: 'http://my-dynamic-endpoint.com/graphql'
  }
})
```

### GraphQL over WebSocket Protocol Executor (`@graphql-tools/executor-graphql-ws`)

This package allows you to create an executor for the service that supports [GraphQL over WebSocket protocol](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md).
WebSockets are usually used for subscriptions or permanent connection for queries and mutations in case of a heavy traffic.

```ts
import { buildGraphQLWSExecutor } from '@graphql-tools/executor-graphql-ws';

const executor = buildGraphQLWSExecutor(
    'ws://localhost:4001/graphql',
    undefined,
    connectionParams: {
        myToken: 'my-token-for-auth'
    }
)
```

#### Combining WS and HTTP executors to use WS only for subscriptions

```ts
import { buildGraphQLWSExecutor } from '@graphql-tools/executor-graphql-ws'
import { buildHTTPExecutor } from '@graphql-tools/executor-http'
import { getOperationAST } from 'graphql'

function buildCombinedExecutor() {
  const httpExecutor = buildHTTPExecutor({
    endpoint: 'http://localhost:4001/graphql'
  })
  const wsExecutor = buildGraphQLWSExecutor('ws://localhost:4001/graphql')
  return request => {
    if (request.operationType === 'subscription') {
      return wsExecutor(request)
    }
    return httpExecutor(request)
  }
}
```

### Creating a custom executor

You can use an executor with any fetching algorithm that takes an `ExecutorRequest` and returns `ExecutionResult`. An executor is a function capable of retrieving GraphQL results. It is the same way that a GraphQL Client handles fetching data and is used by several `graphql-tools` features to do introspection or fetch results during execution.

```ts
type AsyncExecutor = (request: ExecutorRequest) => Promise<ExecutionResult>

type ExecutorRequest = {
  document: DocumentNode
  variables?: Object
  operationName?: string
  operationType?: 'query' | 'mutation' | 'subscription'
  context?: Object
  info?: GraphQLResolveInfo
}
```

### Create a custom HTTP executor using Fetch

```ts
import { fetch } from '@whatwg-node/fetch'
import { print } from 'graphql'
import { AsyncExecutor } from '@graphql-tools/utils'

const executor: AsyncExecutor = async ({ document, variables }) => {
  const query = print(document)
  const fetchResult = await fetch('http://example.com/graphql', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ query, variables })
  })
  return fetchResult.json()
}
```

### Create a hybrid executor to use WS for subscriptions

Sometimes you only want to do subscription operations over WebSocket. In that case, you have identified the operation and then call the corresponding executor for the operation type.

With this executor query and mutation operations will be executed over HTTP (using `@whatwg-node/fetch`) and subscription operations will be executed via WebSocket (using `graphql-ws`).

```ts
import { fetch } from '@whatwg-node/fetch'
import { print, getOperationAST, OperationTypeNode } from 'graphql'
import { observableToAsyncIterable, AsyncExecutor } from '@graphql-tools/utils'
import { createClient } from 'graphql-ws'

const HTTP_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT = 'http://localhost:3000/graphql'
const WS_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT = 'ws://localhost:3000/graphql'

const subscriptionClient = createClient({
  url: WS_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT
})

const httpExecutor: AsyncExecutor = async ({ document, variables, operationName, extensions }) => {
  const query = print(document)
  const fetchResult = await fetch(HTTP_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ query, variables, operationName, extensions })
  })
  return fetchResult.json()
}

const wsExecutor: AsyncExecutor = async ({ document, variables, operationName, extensions }) =>
  observableToAsyncIterable({
    subscribe: observer => ({
      unsubscribe: subscriptionClient.subscribe(
        {
          query: print(document),
          variables: variables as Record<string, any>,
          operationName,
          extensions
        },
        {
          next: data => observer.next?.(data as unknown),
          error(err) {
            if (!observer.error) return
            if (err instanceof Error) {
              observer.error(err)
            } else if (err instanceof CloseEvent) {
              observer.error(new Error(`Socket closed with event ${err.code}`))
            } else if (Array.isArray(err)) {
              // GraphQLError[]
              observer.error(new Error(err.map(({ message }) => message).join(', ')))
            }
          },
          complete: () => observer.complete?.()
        }
      )
    })
  })

const executor: AsyncExecutor = async args => {
  // get the operation node of from the document that should be executed
  const operation = getOperationAST(args.document, args.operationName)
  // subscription operations should be handled by the wsExecutor
  if (operation?.operation === OperationTypeNode.SUBSCRIPTION) {
    return wsExecutor(args)
  }
  // all other operations should be handles by the httpExecutor
  return httpExecutor(args)
}
```

## Introspecting Schemas using Executors

If you don't have the schema definitions as a URL or a local file, you can introspect the endpoint to fetch the schema.
After creating an executor, you can use `introspectSchema` to fetch the schema.

```ts
import { introspectSchema } from '@graphql-tools/wrap'
import { buildHTTPExecutor } from '@graphql-tools/executor-http'

const executor = buildHTTPExecutor({
  endpoint: 'http://localhost:4001/graphql'
})
const schema = await introspectSchema(executor)

const subschema = {
  schema,
  executor
}
```
