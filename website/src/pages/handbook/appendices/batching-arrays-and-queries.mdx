# Batching Arrays and Queries

## What is Array Batching?

It's quite common for stitching to fetch supporting data for each record in an array. Given
`[1, 2, 5]` as an array of record IDs, we _could_ query a subschema for each of those records
individually:

```graphql
# product(id: Int!): Product

query {
  product(id: 1) {
    name
  }
}
query {
  product(id: 2) {
    name
  }
}
query {
  product(id: 5) {
    name
  }
}
```

However, this is pretty inefficient (yes, this is absolutely an N+1 query). Each query must be
delegated, resolved, and call the database individually. This would be significantly more efficient
to resolve all of these records at once using an array service:

```graphql
# products(ids: [Int!]!): [Product]!

query {
  products(ids: [1, 2, 5]) {
    name
  }
}
```

That, in a nutshell, is array batching. Rather than performing a delegation for each record in a
list, we'll perform one delegation _total_ on behalf of the entire list.

## What is Query Batching?

Batch execution, also known as "query batching", is a high-level strategy for combining all queries
performed during an execution cycle into one GraphQL operation sent to a subschema. This will
combine both array-batched and single-record queries performed across GraphQL types into one
operation that executes all at once.

For example, given the following queries generated during an execution cycle:

```graphql
query {
  products(ids: [1, 2, 5]) {
    name
  }
}
query {
  seller(id: 7) {
    name
  }
}
query {
  seller(id: 8) {
    name
  }
}
query {
  buyer(id: 9) {
    name
  }
}
```

All of these discrete queries get rewritten into a single operation sent to the subschema:

```graphql
query {
  products_0: products(ids: [1, 2, 5]) {
    name
  }
  seller_0: seller(id: 7) {
    name
  }
  seller_1: seller(id: 8) {
    name
  }
  buyer_0: buyer(id: 9) {
    name
  }
}
```

A batching executor keeps track of the root aliases used for each operation in the batched set, and
handles unpacking the results into their original requests.

This aggregate of queries has many advantages: it consolidates network requests sent to remote
servers, and apps with synchronous execution have the opportunity to batch behaviors within the
single executable operation. GraphQL Tools'
[batch-execute](https://github.com/ardatan/graphql-tools/tree/master/packages/batch-execute) package
handles all the logistics of remapping batched field aliases and any resulting errors. An
alternative implementation of execution batching
[uses arrays](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/apollo-client/performance/batching-client-graphql-queries/#5853)
to send multiple operations at once, though it only works with GraphQL servers setup to accept
arrays and trusts that the server enables multiplexing.

## Why use both?

It's easy to assume that query batching eliminates the need for array batching. However, there is
distinct value in using both in tandem together.

- **Array batching** optimizes _gateway execution performance_. Each time the gateway schema
  delegates (or, proxies) down to a subschema, there are associated overhead costs. The delegation
  process must filter the request selection to match the subschema, remap abstract types, etc. Given
  an array of 10 records to fetch, it's far better to perform this delegation process once for the
  set rather than repeating it for each record.

- **Query batching** optimizes _networking and subservice performance_. Once delegations have been
  initiated (and ideally as few as possible using array batching), query batching will consolidate
  all delegations into a single operation sent to the subschema. This optimizes networking with the
  subschema, and allows most applications to better streamline their processing of the request.
