# Federation to Stitching SDL

This example demonstrates the integration of
[Apollo Federation services](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/) into a stitched schema.

As you get the hang of schema stitching, you may find that Federation services are fairly complex
for what they do. The `buildFederatedSchema` method from the `@apollo/federation` package creates a
nuanced GraphQL resource that does not guarentee itself to be independently consistent, but plugs
seamlessly into a greater automation package. By comparison, stitching encourages services to be
independently valid and self-contained GraphQL resources, which makes them quite primitive and
durable. While federation automates service bindings at the cost of tightly-coupled complexity,
stitching embraces loosely-coupled bindings at the cost of manual setup. The merits of each strategy
are likely to be a deciding factor for developers selecting a platform. Stitching is a _library_
used to build a _framework_ like Federation.

Stitching is less opinionated than Federation, and is made considerably simpler without the
complexity added by `buildFederatedSchema`. However, when integrating with existing servers or in
the process of a migration, nothing says you can't incorporate your existing federation resources
into a stitched gateway going through the
[federation `_entities` query](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/federation-spec/#query_service)
– which is fundamentally just a GraphQL service.

**This example demonstrates:**

- Integrating Apollo Federation services into a stitched schema.
- Fetching and parsing Federation SDLs.

The following services are available for interactive queries:

- **Stitched gateway:** listening on 4000/graphql
- _Products subservice_: listening on 4001/graphql
- _Reviews subservice_: listening on 4002/graphql
- _Users subservice_: listening on 4003/graphql

This example is based on the
[Federation intro example](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/#concern-based-separation).

## Summary

Ever wonder what Federation is doing under the hood? Visit the
[products service](http://localhost:4001/graphql) and check out some `User` objects:

```graphql
query {
  _entities(
    representations: [
      { __typename: "User", id: "1" }
      { __typename: "User", id: "2" }
      { __typename: "User", id: "3" }
    ]
  ) {
    ... on User {
      id
      recentPurchases {
        upc
        name
        price
      }
    }
  }
}
```

A federation service automatically configures an `_entities` query that recieves typed keys (i.e.:
objects with a `__typename`), and returns abstract `_Entity` objects that may assume the shape of
any type in the service. [Apollo Gateway](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@apollo/gateway) then
automates the exchange of typed keys for typed results, all going through the dedicated `_entities`
protocol in each subservice. Stitching can also integrate with this `_entities` query by sending it
properly formatted keys.

Now [go to the gateway](http://localhost:4001/graphql) and check out the stitched results:

```graphql
query {
  user(id: "1") {
    username
    recentPurchases {
      upc
      name
    }
    reviews {
      body
      author {
        id
        username
      }
      product {
        upc
        name
        acceptsNewReviews
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The stitched gateway has loaded all federation SDLs, converted them into stitching SDLs, and then
integrates them like any other GraphQL service with types merged through their `_entities` query.

### Adapting Federation services

Federation and Stitching use fundamentally similar patterns to combine underlying subservices (in
fact, both tools have shared origins in
[Apollo Stitching](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/migrating-from-stitching/)).
However, their specific implementations have an important differentiator:

- **Apollo Federation uses a _centralized_ approach**, where all types have a single "origin"
  service (i.e.: where the unextended type definition is). Querying for a type builds from its
  origin service.
- **Stitching uses a _decentralized_ approach**, where any service may equally originate any type.
  Regardless of where a typed object is first represented, that original object is filled in with
  missing details from other services.

How each system handles origins informs how a federation service gets translated into a stitched
subschema:

1. All types with a `@key` directive become merged types; the key fields go into `selectionSet`.
1. All fields with a `@requires` directive are made into computed fields. Computed fields are
   slightly more robust than their federation counterparts because they may resolve dependencies
   from any number of services.
1. All fields with an `@external` directive are removed _unless they are part of the `@key`_.
   Stitching expects schemas to only publish fields that they actually have data for. This is
   considerably simpler than the federation approach where services may be responsible for data they
   don't have.
1. By eliminating the indirection of `@external` fields, the `@provides` directive is no longer
   necessary. The Stitching query planner can automate the optimial selection of as many fields as
   possible from as few services as possible.

### SDL integration

The simplest way to make the above adaptions is to translate a Federation SDL string into a
Stitching SDL string, which can be done using the `federationToStitchingSDL` utility function from
[`@graphql-tools/stitching-directives`](https://www.graphql-tools.com/docs/schema-stitching/stitch-federation)
package. A federation service's SDL can be obtained through its `_service` API:

```graphql
query {
  _service {
    sdl
  }
}
```

Once fetched, it can be translated into a Stitching SDL and then built into a stitched schema:

```js
import { buildSchema } from 'graphql'
import { buildHTTPExecutor } from '@graphql-tools/executor-http'
import { federationToStitchingSDL, stitchingDirectives } from '@graphql-tools/stitching-directives'

const stitchingConfig = stitchingDirectives()

const executor = buildHTTPExecutor({ endpoint: 'http://localhost:4001/graphql' })
const federationSDL = await executor({
  document: parse(/* GraphQL */ `
    {
      _service {
        sdl
      }
    }
  `)
})
const stitchingSDL = federationToStitchingSDL(federationSDL, stitchingConfig)

const gatewaySchema = stitchSchemas({
  subschemaConfigTransforms: [stitchingConfig.stitchingDirectivesTransformer],
  subschemas: [
    {
      schema: buildSchema(stitchingSDL),
      executor
    }
  ]
})
```

### Static config

Written as static subservice configuration, a federation service merges types within a stitched
gateway using the following:

```js
import { pick } from 'lodash'

const gatewaySchema = stitchSchemas({
  subschemas: [
    {
      schema: buildSchema(stitchingSDL),
      merge: {
        Product: {
          selectionSet: '{ id }',
          fields: {
            shippingEstimate: { selectionSet: '{ price weight }', computed: true }
          },
          fieldName: '_entities',
          key: originObj => ({
            __typename: 'Product',
            ...pick(originObj, ['id', 'price', 'weight'])
          }),
          argsFromKeys: representations => ({ representations })
        }
      }
    }
  ]
})
```
