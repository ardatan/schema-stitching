# Federation Supergraph

This example demonstrates how to consume the federation supergraph for a stitching gateway using
`@graphql-tools/federation` package.

Schema Stitching is a framework or set of libraries that allows you to create gateways with a
specific programmatic configuration. So it is flexible enough to consume any spec like Federation or
Stitching SDL to create a gateway.

A federation supergraph SDL can be generated using Apollo Rover CLI. You can install Apollo Rover
CLI [here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/getting-started). In our example, we create a
`supergraph.yaml` file for Supergraph configuration, and use
`rover supergraph compose --config ./supergraph.yaml > supergraph.graphql` to generate an SDL for
our gateway;

```yaml
subgraphs:
  accounts:
    routing_url: http://localhost:4001/graphql
    schema:
      file: ./services/accounts.graphql
  inventory:
    routing_url: http://localhost:4002/graphql
    schema:
      file: ./services/inventory.graphql
  products:
    routing_url: http://localhost:4003/graphql
    schema:
      file: ./services/products.graphql
  reviews:
    routing_url: http://localhost:4004/graphql
    schema:
      file: ./services/reviews.graphql
```

Or you can get the supergraph sdl from a schema registry like GraphQL Hive

The following services are available for interactive queries:

- **Stitched gateway:** listening on 4000/graphql
- _Accounts_ subservice\_: listening on 4001/graphql
- _Inventory_ subservice\_: listening on 4002/GraphQL
- _Products_ subservice\_: listening on 4003/graphql
- _Reviews_ subservice\_: listening on 4004/graphql

This example is based on the
[Federation intro example](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/#concern-based-separation).

## Summary

You can use `getStitchedSchemaFromSupergraphSdl` from `@graphql-tools/federation` to consume a
supergraph and get an executable `GraphQLSchema` that you can use with any GraphQL server or execute
it locally.

```ts
import { readFileSync } from 'fs'
import { createServer } from 'node:http'
import { createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { getStitchedSchemaFromSupergraphSdl } from '@graphql-tools/federation'

// This doesn't have to be from a file system, it can be fetched via HTTP from a schema registry
const supergraphSdl = readFileSync('./supergraph.graphql').toString()
const schema = await getStitchedSchemaFromSupergraphSdl({ supergraphSdl })
const yoga = createYoga({ schema })
const server = createServer(yoga)

server.listen(4000, () => {
  console.log(`🚀 Server ready at http://localhost:4000/graphql`)
})
```
