# Computed fields

This example demonstrates the core techniques for passing field dependencies between subservices,
covering most of the topics discussed in the official
[computed fields documentation](/docs/approaches/type-merging#computed-fields).

Computed fields involve selecting data from various services, and then sending that data as input
into another service that internally computes a result upon it. If you're familiar with the
`_entities` query of the
[Apollo Federation spec](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/federation-spec/#query_entities),
computed fields work pretty much the same way. Computed fields are fairly complex and therefore not
a preferred solution for basic needs. However, they can solve some tricky problems involving the
directionality of foreign keys.

In general, computed fields are most appropraite when:

- A service holds foreign keys without their associated type information (i.e.: a service knows an
  ID but doesn't know its type). In these cases, the keys can be sent to a remote service to be
  resolved into typed objects.
- A service manages a collection of bespoke GraphQL types that are of no concern to the rest of the
  service architecture. In such cases, it may make sense to encapsulate the service by sending
  external types _in_ for data rather than releasing its types _out_ into the greater service
  architecture.

However, computed fields have several distinct disadvantages:

- A subservice with computed fields cannot independently resolve its full schema without input from
  other services. This means computed fields are defunct holes in a subschema unless accessed
  through the gateway with dependencies satisfied.
- Computed fields rely on passing complex object keys between services rather than primitive scalar
  keys. Where a primitive key may be recognized as empty and therefore skip requesting data, complex
  object keys are always seen as truthy values even if their _contents_ are empty. Thus, the gateway
  is forced to always request data on their behalf, even for predictably empty results unless manual
  intervention is taken.

**This example demonstrates:**

- Configuring computed fields.
- Sending complex inputs to subservices.
- Normalizing subservice deprecations in the gateway.

**Related examples:**

- See [stitching directives SDL](/handbook/foundation/stitching-directives-sdl) to write computed
  fields as schema directives.

The following service is available for interactive queries:

- **Stitched gateway:** listening on 4000/graphql

For simplicity, all subservices in this example are run locally by the gateway server. You could
easily break out any subservice into a standalone remote server following the
[combining local and remote schemas](../combining-local-and-remote-schemas) example.

## Summary

Visit the stitched gateway and try running the following query:

```graphql
query {
  products(upcs: [1, 2, 3, 4]) {
    name
    price
    category {
      name
    }
    metadata {
      __typename
      name
      ... on GeoLocation {
        name
        lat
        lon
      }
      ... on SportsTeam {
        location {
          name
          lat
          lon
        }
      }
      ... on TelevisionSeries {
        season
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `category` and `metadata` associations come from the Metadata service, and are merged with
Products service data using computed fields (this configuration can also be written using
[schema directives](../stitching-directives-sdl)):

```js
merge: {
  Product: {
    fields: {
      category: { selectionSet: '{ categoryId }', computed: true },
      metadata: { selectionSet: '{ metadataIds }', computed: true },
    },
    fieldName: '_products',
    key: ({ categoryId, metadataIds }) => ({ categoryId, metadataIds }),
    argsFromKeys: (keys) => ({ keys }),
  }
}
```

In this pattern, the `category` and `metadata` fields each specify _field-level selection sets_ that
will only be collected from other services when their respective fields are requested. The
additional `computed` setting isolates these fields into a standalone schema that assures the fields
are always requested directly by the gateway with their dependencies provided. Together, the results
of these selection sets are built into an object key and sent off to the Metadata service to be
resolved into its version of the `Product` type.

_metadata schema:_

```graphql
type Product {
  category: Category # @computed(selectionSet: "{ categoryId }")
  metadata: [Metadata] # @computed(selectionSet: "{ metadataIds }")
}

input ProductKey {
  categoryId: ID
  metadataIds: [ID!]
}

type Query {
  _products(keys: [ProductKey!]!): [Product]!
}
```

### Resolving metadata

The `metadata` association is a pretty good candidate for computed fields.

Looking at the way associations are structured, the Products service holds metadata record IDs
without any associated type information. Therefore, the Products service must send these untyped IDs
over to the Metadata service to be resolved into type objects (this is inherently a shortcoming of
the data model&mdash;in a perfect solution, association data would be migrated over to the Metadata
service where both ID and type information is available).

Even if the Products service had all association data available though, there's still some merit in
having the Metadata service _internalize_ the `Product` type rather than _externalizing_ all of its
bespoke Metadata types. Encapsulation of concerns is a valid factor to weigh against implementation
complexity.

### Resolving category

The `catagory` association is needlessly complex using computed fields. It could just as easily use
a [basic foreign key pattern](../type-merging-single-records) in the Products service, which would
eliminate the unsightly `categoryId` field from its schema:

_products schema:_

```graphql
type Product {
  ...
  # categoryId: ID << remove this
  category: Category
}

type Category {
  id: ID!
}
```

### Deprecating subservice inconsistencies

One of the biggest shortcomings of computed fields is their inconsistency&mdash;they cannot be
resolved outside of gateway context where their dependencies are satisfied. If you also utilize the
subservice as a standalone GraphQL resource, then computed fields appear as defunct holes in its
schema.

An imperfect solution to this problem is to deprecate all computed fields in the subservice, and
then remove those deprecations in the gateway proxy layer. For example:

_metadata schema:_

```graphql
type Product {
  category: Category @deprecated(reason: "gateway access only")
  metadata: [Metadata] @deprecated(reason: "gateway access only")
}
```

_index.js:_

```js
import { stitchSchemas } from '@graphql-tools/stitch'
import { RemoveObjectFieldDeprecations } from '@graphql-tools/wrap'
import { metadataSchema } from './services/metadata'

stitchSchemas({
  subschemas: [
    {
      schema: metadataSchema,
      transforms: [new RemoveObjectFieldDeprecations('gateway access only')]
    }
  ]
})
```

The `RemoveObjectFieldDeprecations` transform will un-deprecate these fields within the gateway
schema. The subservice-level deprecations at least offer some insight as to why certain fields don't
work when accessed directly.
