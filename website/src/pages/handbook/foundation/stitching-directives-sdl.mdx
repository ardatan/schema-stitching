# Stitching directives SDL

This example demonstrates the use of stitching directives to configure type merging via subschema
SDLs. Shifting this configuration out of the gateway makes subschemas autonomous, and allows them to
push their own configuration up to the gateway&mdash;enabling more sophisticated schema releases.

The `@graphql-tools/stitching-directives` package provides importable directives that can be used to
annotate types and fields within subschemas, a validator to ensure the directives are used
appropriately, and a configuration transformer that can be used on the gateway to convert the
subschema directives into explicit configuration setting.

Note: the service setup in this example is based on the
[official demonstration repository](https://github.com/apollographql/federation-demo) for
[Apollo Federation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/).

**This example demonstrates:**

- `@key` directive for type-level selection sets.
- `@merge` directive for type merging services.
- `@computed` directive for computed fields.
- `@canonical` directive for preferred element definitions.

The following services are available for interactive queries:

- **Stitched gateway:** listening on 4000/graphql
- _Accounts subservice_: listening on 4001/graphql
- _Inventory subservice_: listening on 4002/graphql
- _Products subservice_: listening on 4003/graphql
- _Reviews subservice_: listening on 4004/graphql

## Summary

First, try a query that includes data from all services:

```graphql
query {
  products(upcs: [1, 2]) {
    name
    price
    weight
    inStock
    shippingEstimate
    reviews {
      id
      body
      author {
        name
        username
        totalReviews
      }
      product {
        name
        price
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Neat, it works! All those merges were configured through schema SDL annotations. Let's review the
patterns used in this example and compare them to their static configuration counterparts. Keep in
mind: SDL directives are always just annotations for the static configuration that's been discussed
throughout previous chapters.

### Single picked key

Open the Accounts schema and see the expression of a
[single-record merge query](../type-merging-single-records):

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  username: String!
}

type Query {
  user(id: ID!): User @merge(keyField: "id")
}
```

This translates into the following configuration:

```js
merge: {
  User: {
    selectionSet: '{ id }'
    fieldName: 'user',
    args: (id) => ({ id }),
  }
}
```

Here the `@merge(keyField: "id")` directive marks a merger query, and specifies that the `id` field
acts as a selectionSet to be fetched with the original object and picked as the query argument.

### Picked keys with additional arguments

Next, open the Products schema and see the expression of an
[array-batched merge query](../type-merging-arrays):

```graphql
type Product {
  upc: ID!
}

type Query {
  products(upcs: [ID!]!, order: String): [Product]!
    @merge(
      keyField: "upc"
      keyArg: "upcs"
      additionalArgs: """
      order: "price"
      """
    )
}
```

This translates into the following configuration:

```js
merge: {
  Product: {
    selectionSet: '{ upc }'
    fieldName: 'products',
    key: ({ upc }) => upc,
    argsFromKeys: (upcs) => ({ upcs, order: 'price' }),
  }
}
```

Again, the `@merge(keyField: "upc")` directive marks a merger array query, and specifies that the
`upc` field acts as a selectionSet to be fetched with each original object and picked into the query
argument array. The `keyArg` argument specifies which query argument receives the array of keys, and
`additionalArgs` specifies static values to provide for other arguments.

### Object keys

Now open the Inventory schema and see the expression of an object key, denoted by a generic scalar
(here called `_Key`). In the absence of `keyField`, a generated key assumes the shape of a typed
object like those sent to [federation services](../federation-services):

```graphql
type Product @key(selectionSet: "{ upc }") {
  upc: ID!
  shippingEstimate: Int @computed(selectionSet: "{ price weight }")
}

scalar _Key

type Query {
  _products(keys: [_Key!]!): [Product]! @merge
}
```

This translates into the following configuration:

```js
// assume "pick" works like the lodash method...
merge: {
  Product: {
    selectionSet: '{ upc }',
    fields: {
      shippingEstimate: { selectionSet: '{ price weight }', computed: true },
    },
    fieldName: '_products',
    key: (obj) => ({ __typename: 'Product', ...pick(obj, ['upc', 'price', 'weight']) }),
    argsFromKeys: (keys) => ({ keys }),
  }
}
```

The `_Key` scalar is an object with a `__typename` and all _utilized_ selectionSet fields on the
type. For example, when the computed `shippingEstimate` field is requested, the resulting object
keys look like:

```js
;[
  { upc: '1', price: 899, weight: 100, __typename: 'Product' },
  { upc: '2', price: 1299, weight: 1000, __typename: 'Product' }
]
```

However, when `shippingEstimate` is NOT requested, the generated object keys will only contain
fields from the base selectionSet:

```js
;[
  { upc: '1', __typename: 'Product' },
  { upc: '2', __typename: 'Product' }
]
```

### Typed inputs

Similar to the [object keys](#object-keys) discussed above, an input object type may be used to
constrain the specific fields included on a object key:

```graphql
type User @key(selectionSet: "{ id }") {
  id: ID!
}

input UserKey {
  id: ID!
}

type Query {
  _users(keys: [UserKey!]!): [User]! @merge
}
```

This translates into the following configuration:

```js
// assume "pick" works like the lodash method...
merge: {
  User: {
    selectionSet: '{ id }',
    fieldName: '_users',
    key: (obj) => pick(obj, ['id']),
    argsFromKeys: (keys) => ({ keys }),
  }
}
```

In this case, the generated object keys will contain nothing but utilized selectionSet fields that
are whitelisted by the input type:

```json
[{ "id": "1" }, { "id": "2" }]
```

### Nested inputs

A more advanced form of [typed input keys](#typed-inputs), this pattern uses the `keyArg` parameter
to specify an input path at which to format the stitching query arguments:

```graphql
type Product @key(selectionSet: "{ upc }") {
  upc: ID!
}

input ProductKey {
  upc: ID!
}

input ProductInput {
  keys: [ProductKey!]!
}

type Query {
  _products(input: ProductInput): [Product]! @merge(keyArg: "input.keys")
}
```

### Canonical definitions

Open the documentation sidebar of GraphiQL for the gateway schema, and have a look at the `Product`
type definition. While this type is defined in three different ways by three different services,
you'll see that element descriptions from the Products subschema are favored in the combined gateway
schema because it is marked as `@canonical`:

```graphql
"Represents a Product available for resale."
type Product @canonical {
  # ...
}
```

Types marked as canonical will provide a preferred definition of the type and its fields to the
combined gateway schema. That means we can write clean descriptions for a type and its fields in one
service, and expect those definitions to be used in the combined gateway schema. Specific fields may
also be marked as canonical to override a canonical type definition. Fields that are unique to a
given subservice have no competing definitions, and are therefore canonical by default.

### For demonstration only!

This example uses several needlessly complex key patterns for the sake of demonstration. For
simplicity, it's generally best to use the basic picked key patterns whenever possible. Sending
object keys is generally only necessary when implementing computed fields or communicating with
federation services.
