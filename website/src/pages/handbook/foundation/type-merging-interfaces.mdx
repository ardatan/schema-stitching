# Cross-service interfaces

This example explores setting up a GraphQL interface that spans across service boundaries, as
described in the [merged interfaces documentation](/docs/approaches/type-merging#merged-interfaces).
This is an easily overlooked feature made possible by the flexibility of type merging.

**This example demonstrates:**

- Distributing a GraphQL interface across services.

The following service is available for interactive queries:

- **Stitched gateway:** listening on 4000/graphql

For simplicity, all subservices in this example are run locally by the gateway server. You could
easily break out any subservice into a standalone remote server following the
[combining local and remote schemas](/handbook/foundation/combining-local-and-remote-schemas)
example.

## Summary

Visit the stitched gateway and try running the following query:

```graphql
query {
  storefront(id: "1") {
    id
    name
    productOfferings {
      __typename
      id
      name
      price
      ... on ProductDeal {
        products {
          name
          price
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If you study the results here, `Storefront.productOfferings` field returns the `ProductOffering`
interface:

```graphql
# Products schema
interface ProductOffering {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  price: Float!
}
```

This interface is implemented by two types:

- `Product`: a basic product record from the Products service.
- `ProductDeal`: a wrapper for a set of products given a special price, managed in the Storefronts
  service.

The oddity here is that the Storefronts service knows `Product` only with an `id` field, therefore
Storefronts is not able to implement the full interface, it may only implement a subset of it:

```graphql
# Storefronts schema
interface ProductOffering {
  id: ID!
}
```

This is where the flexibility of type merging really shines. By virtue of the merge, `ProductDeal`
will adopt the full `ProductOffering` interface in the combined gateway schema.

However, that means the gateway schema provides an interface of fields for a type that the
underlying subservice does _not_ provide. This difference in interface fields is automatically
translated using typed fragments. For example, try the following query:

```graphql
query {
  storefront(id: "1") {
    productOfferings {
      id
      name
      price
    }
  }
}
```

The above requests the full `ProductOffering` interface from the gateway schema. Comparing this to
the query delegated to the Storefronts subservice, you'll see that the interface selections have
been expanded into typed fragments that are compatible with the Storefronts schema:

```graphql
query ($graphqlTools0__v0_id: ID!) {
  graphqlTools0_storefront: storefront(id: $graphqlTools0__v0_id) {
    productOfferings {
      id
      ... on Product {
        __typename
        id
      }
      ... on ProductDeal {
        __typename
        name
        price
      }
      __typename
    }
  }
}
```
