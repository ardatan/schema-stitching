# Array-batched type merging

This example explores the core techniques for merging typed objects using array queries, covering
most of the topics discussed in
[batched merging documentation](/docs/approaches/type-merging#batching).

This example focuses on
[array batching](/handbook/appendices/batching-arrays-and-queries#what-is-array-batching)&mdash;meaning
that all records accessed during a round of delegation are batched together and loaded as an array.
This technique greatly reduces the execution overhead of
[single-record merges](../02-single-record-type-merging), and can be further optimized by enabling
[query batching](/handbook/appendices/batching-arrays-and-queries#what-is-query-batching). This
array-batched strategy is prefereable to single-record merges and should be used whenever possible.

**This example demonstrates:**

- [One-way type merging](/docs/approaches/type-merging#basic-example) using array queries.
- [Multi-directional type merging](/docs/approaches/type-merging#unidirectional-merges) using array
  queries.
- Handling array errors.
- Nullability & error remapping.

**Related examples:**

- See [single-record type merging](/handbook/foundation/type-merging-single-records) for additional
  information on basic merge patterns.
- See [stitching directives SDL](/handbook/foundation/stitching-directives-sdl) to write this merge
  configuration as schema directives.

The following services are available for interactive queries:

- **Stitched gateway:** listening on 4000/graphql
- _Manufacturers subservice_: listening on 4001/graphql
- _Products subservice_: listening on 4002/graphql
- _Storefronts subservice_: listening on 4003/graphql

## Summary

Visit the stitched gateway and try running the following query:

```graphql
query {
  storefront(id: "2") {
    id
    name
    products {
      upc
      name
      manufacturer {
        products {
          upc
          name
        }
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If you study the results of this query, the final composition traverses across the service graph:

- `Storefront` (Storefronts schema)
  - `Storefront.products -> Product` (Products schema)
    - `Product.manufacturer -> Manufacturer` (Products + Manufacturers schemas)
      - `Manufacturer.products` (Products schema)
      - `Manufacturer.name` (Manufacturers schema)

That means the gateway performed three rounds of resolution for each service's data
(`Services -> Products -> Manufacturers`). With the array-batching technique, the gateway only
performs a single delegation per round, regardless of the number of records in the round.

## Error handling

Pay special attention to the error handling used while resolving record arrays:

```js
manufacturers(root, { ids }) {
  return ids.map(id => manufacturers.find(m => m.id === id) || new NotFoundError());
}
```

It is extremely important that errors get _mapped_ into the result set, rather than being thrown
(which corrupts the entire result set).

## Nullability + mapped errors

Also run a query for the Product with UPC `"6"`, and you'll see an interesting feature of error
handling:

```graphql
query {
  products(upcs: ["6"]) {
    upc
    name
    manufacturer {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

For the purposes of this example, this product intentionally specifies an invalid manufacturer
reference. You'll see that the original error from the underlying subservice has flowed through the
stitching process and is mapped to its final document position in the stitched schema:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Record not found",
      "locations": [],
      "path": ["products", 0, "manufacturer"],
      "extensions": {
        "code": "NOT_FOUND"
      }
    }
  ],
  "data": {
    "products": [
      {
        "upc": "6",
        "name": "Baseball Glove",
        "manufacturer": null
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Note that for this process to work, the `Product.manufacturer` reference must be
[nullable](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#lists-and-non-null), otherwise you'll get a GraphQL
nullability-mismatch error when the manufacturer returns an error. For this reason, **it's generally
best-practice to make all stitched associations nullable** on the assumption that the record
association _could_ fail, at which time it's better to see the subschema failure than a top-level
GraphQL nullability error.
