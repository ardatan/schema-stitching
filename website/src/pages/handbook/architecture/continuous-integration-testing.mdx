# Continuous Integration Testing

This example demonstrates setting up test coverage for a stitched schema. Like all application code,
sitched schemas are subject to development errors and therefore should also be tested rigorously
through a continuous integration pipeline while
[versioning schema releases](../versioning-schema-releases).

Effective test coverage happens at two levels:

1. **Subservices are tested individually.** Subservices are normally managed in their own repos, and
   should have their own exhaustive test coverage of their schema, resolver code, and database
   transactions. Testing a standalone service API follows standard software development practices
   and is [widely](https://blog.testproject.io/2020/06/23/testing-graphql-api/)
   [discussed](https://medium.com/entria/testing-a-graphql-server-using-jest-4e00d0e4980e)
   elsewhere. With subservice test coverage in place, the gateway should take subschemas at
   face-value as GraphQL resources that "just work".
2. **The gateway app tests the stitched schema.** Within the gateway repo, we'll want to stitch all
   subschemas together and then validate interactions between subschemas. Having subschemas simply
   compose together without error is not necessarily a reflection on implementation integrity. This
   testing process is unique, so is discussed at length below.

**This example demonstrates:**

- Adding test coverage to a stitched schema.
- Mocking subservices as local test fixtures.

  that accompany testing.

The main focus of this example is the test suite itself. The basic server configuration is only
provided for context.

## Summary

This example builds a test suite around some organization strategies:

1. Versioned copies of subservice schemas are available in the stitched gateway's repo. As discussed
   in [versioning schema releases](../versioning-schema-releases), there are numerous advantages to
   versioning published subservice schemas with the gateway application&mdash;among them being the
   ability to test subschemas and stitching code together.
2. The `schema_builder.ts` code builds a stitched schema used by the production server _and the test
   suite_. In this example, subschema configs are built separately from the stitched schema; this
   allows tests to build subschema configs, adjust them for testing, and then build them into the
   stitched schema.

### Mocking subservices

Remote subservices are not available during continuous integration testing, so the gateway test
suite must localize remote interactions. There are numerous ways to do this, some work better than
others...

- **Recorded tests:** packages such as [node-replay](https://github.com/assaf/node-replay) will
  record HTTP interactions within development mode and "play them back" during subsequent testing.
  Recorded tests are notoriously fragile, and stitching interactions are no exception. Incremental
  updates in stitching code may modify subservice requests in benign ways (reordering fields, etc),
  and that may invalidate recorded tests.
- **Mocked endpoints:** packages such as [nock](https://github.com/nock/nock) allow network
  endpoints to be mocked with static data responses. While this pattern is more tolerant of library
  updates, it's also quite fragile when curated subservice responses grow stale over time.
- **Mocked subschemas:** the most durable approach to testing a stitched schema is to run live
  GraphQL exchanges from end-to-end via mocking. Assuming that subservices are rigorously tested in
  isolation, a locally-mocked schema becomes a drop-in replacement for its service contract. Mocks
  will dynamically follow evolutions in stitching code, and stale data fixtures will break within
  the mock itself, forcing tests to be updated.

This example builds simple mock service implementations within the `test/mock_services` directory.
Each mocked service contains `resolvers` for fulfilling select fields with simple data fixtures, and
`mocks` used to fill in static values for unspecified fields. Note that in `test_helper.js`, all
services fill in unresolved strings with a constant service-specific value:

```graphql
mocks: {
  String: () => `${name}-value`,
}
```

This makes all unspecified `String` fields return a constant `"serviceName-value"`; a similar
pattern is used in the Products service to return a constant integer. These mocked subservice
schemas make all fields resolve either a data fixture, or else a recognizable constant provided by
the schema.

### Writing test queries

When writing queries against a mocked gateway schema, you can probe as deeply as you'd like into
resolver paths that span across services, and expect them to return fully-formed results:

```js
const { data } = await queryMockedGateway(/* GraphQL */ `
  {
    user(id: "1") {
      # id << must work without this selected
      name
      username
      reviews {
        # id << must work without this selected
        body
        product {
          # upc << must work without this selected
          name
          price
          weight
        }
      }
    }
  }
`)
```

However, notice that fields included in `@key(selectionSet: ...)` directives have been deliberately
commented out (`id` and `upc`). We expect the stitching implementation to automatically collect key
selection fields used to connect services, so we're placing higher expectations upon the stitching
implementation by NOT selecting these fields manually.
