# Public &amp; private APIs

This example demonstrates filtering unwanted elements from the public schema, and serving public and
private versions of the stitched schema for internal and external use.

**This example demonstrates:**

- Filtering unwanted fields from the final stitched schema.
- Serving public (filtered) and private (unfiltered) API versions.

The following services are available for interactive queries:

- **Public (filtered) gateway:** listening on 4000/public/graphql
- **Private (unfiltered) gateway:** listening on 4000/private/graphql

For simplicity, all subservices in this example are run locally by the gateway server. You could
easily break out any subservice into a standalone remote server following the
[combining local and remote schemas](../combining-local-and-remote-schemas) example.

## Summary

- Go to the [private gateway](http://localhost:4000/private/graphql) and open the documentation
  sidebar.
- Now go to the [public gateway](http://localhost:4000/public/graphql) and compare the documentation
  sidebar.

The last step in composing a clean and elegant gateway schema is to remove internal implementation
details that should not be made available to the general public. You'll notice that the private
gateway includes all artifacts of our original stitched schema, including underscored service names
such as `_sdl`, `_users` and `_products`, and the underscored argument `_scope`. By constrast, the
public gateway has removed these. This is quite simple using `filterSchema` and `pruneSchema`
helpers from GraphQL Tools utils:

```ts
import { filterSchema, pruneSchema } from '@graphql-tools/utils'

const privateSchema = makeGatewaySchema()
const publicSchema = pruneSchema(
  filterSchema({
    schema: privateSchema,
    rootFieldFilter: (type, fieldName) => !fieldName.startsWith('_'),
    fieldFilter: (type, fieldName) => !fieldName.startsWith('_'),
    argumentFilter: (typeName, fieldName, argName) => !argName.startsWith('_')
  })
)
```

Filtering a schema will remove unwanted elements, and pruning it will cleanup orphans. This results
in two versions of our schema: the complete original schema, and the groomed public schema. Each of
these schemas may be served at their own endpoint&mdash;this gives public consumers one API with
access limitations, while the complete set of fields remain available for internal purposes at
another location:

```ts
export const gatewayApp = createRouter()

gatewayApp.all(
  '/private/graphql',
  createYoga({
    schema: privateSchema,
    maskedErrors: false,
    graphqlEndpoint: '/private/graphql',
    graphiql: {
      title: 'Private API'
    }
  })
)

gatewayApp.all(
  '/public/graphql',
  createYoga({
    schema: publicSchema,
    maskedErrors: false,
    graphqlEndpoint: '/public/graphql',
    graphiql: {
      title: 'Public API'
    }
  })
)
```
