# Adding Transforms

Another strategy to avoid conflicts while combining schemas is to modify one or more of the
subschemas using [transforms](/docs/transforms). Transforming allows a schema to be groomed in such
ways as adding namespaces, renaming types, or removing fields (to name a few) prior to stitching it
into the combined gateway schema. These transforms should be added directly to subschema config:

```js
import { FilterRootFields, RenameTypes } from '@graphql-tools/wrap'

const postsSubschema = {
  schema: postsSchema,
  transforms: [
    new FilterRootFields((operation, rootField) => rootField !== 'postsByUserId'),
    new RenameTypes(name => `Post_${name}`)
  ]
}
```

In the example above, we transform the `postsSchema` by removing the `postsByUserId` root field and
adding a `Post_` prefix to all types in the schema. These modifications will only be present in the
combined gateway schema.

Note that when [automatically merging types](/docs/getting-started/duplicate-types#automatic-merge),
all transforms are applied _prior_ to merging. That means transformed types will merge based on
their transformed names within the combined gateway schema.
