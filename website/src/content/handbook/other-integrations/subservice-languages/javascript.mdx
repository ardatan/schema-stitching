# JavaScript Code-First Schemas

This example demonstrates the use of stitching directives to configure type merging, similar to the
prior example, but uses code-first schemas instead of SDL.

The `@graphql-tools/stitching-directives` package provides importable directives definitions that
can be used to annotate types and fields within subschemas, a validator to ensure the directives are
used appropriately, and a configuration transformer that can be used on the gateway to convert the
subschema directives into explicit configuration setting.

It also provides pre-built directives to be used with code-first schemas that do not parse SDL. The
validator is configured to read directives from GraphQL entity extensions, which actually take
priority when present over the SDL.

The `@graphql-tools/utils` package also exports a function that can print these "directives within
extensions" as actual directives that can be then exposed via subservice to the gateway.

Note: the service setup in this example is based on the
[official demonstration repository](https://github.com/apollographql/federation-demo) for
[Apollo Federation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/).

**This example demonstrates:**

- Use of the @key, @computed and @merge "directives within extensions" to specify type merging
  configuration.

The following services are available for interactive queries:

- **Stitched gateway:** listening on 4000/graphql
- _Accounts subservice_: listening on 4001/graphql
- _Inventory subservice_: listening on 4002/graphql
- _Products subservice_: listening on 4003/graphql
- _Reviews subservice_: listening on 4004/graphql

## Summary

First, try a query that includes data from all services:

```graphql
query {
  products(upcs: [1, 2]) {
    name
    price
    weight
    inStock
    shippingEstimate
    reviews {
      id
      body
      author {
        name
        username
        totalReviews
      }
      product {
        name
        price
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Neat, it works! All those merges were configured through schema annotations within schemas!

### Accounts subservice

The Accounts subservice showcases how schemas created with vanilla `graphql-js` can also utilize
stitching directives to achieve the benefits of colocating types and their merge configuration,
including support for hot-reloading:

- _Directive usages_: implemented as "directives within extensions," i.e. following the
  Gatsby/graphql-compose convention of embedding third party directives under the `directives` key
  of each GraphQL entity's `extensions` property.
- _Directive declarations_: directly added to the schema by using the compiled directives exported
  by the `@graphql-tools/stitching-directives` package.

### Inventory subservice

The Inventory subservice demonstrates using stitching directives with a schema created using the
`nexus` library:

- _Directive usages_: implemented as "directives within extensions," i.e. following the
  Gatsby/graphql-compose convention of embedding third party directives under the `directives` key
  of each GraphQL entity's `extensions` property.
- _Directive declarations_: `nexus` does not yet support passing in built `graph-js`
  `GraphQLDirective` objects, but you can easily create a new schema from the `nexus` schema
  programatically (using
  `new GraphQLSchema({ ...originalSchema.toConfig(), directives: [...originalSchema.getDirectives(), ...allStitchingDirectives] })`.

### Products subservice

The Products subservice shows how `TypeGraphQL` can easily implement third party directives
including stitching directives.

- _Directive usages_: implemented using the @Directive decorator syntax, TypeGraphQL's method of
  supporting third party directives within its code-first schema.
- _Directive declarations_: directly added to the schema by using the compiled directives exported
  by the `@graphql-tools/stitching-directives` package.

# Reviews subservice

The Reviews subservice is available for comparison to remind us of how `makeExecutableSchema`
utilizes directives with SDL.

- _Directive usages_: implemented using directives within actual SDL.
- _Directive declarations_: directive type definitions are imported from the
  `@graphql-tools/stitching-directives` package.
