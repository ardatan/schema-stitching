# Subservice languages

A stitched gateway that is [configured by SDL directives](/docs/approaches/stitching-directives) is
unconcerned with what programming language(s) subservices use as long as they can provide an
annotated SDL and fulfill that schema contract. The examples below demonstrate setting up stitching
SDLs using a variety of languages and tools.

When using [static JavaScript stitching config](/docs/approaches/type-merging), subservices don't
even need to provide an annotated SDL, at which time no special subservice setup is necessary.

- **[Ruby](/handbook/other-integrations/subservice-languages/ruby)** schemas created with:
  - Class-based definitions
