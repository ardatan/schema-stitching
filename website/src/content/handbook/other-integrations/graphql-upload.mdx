# GraphQL Upload

This example has two independent services that are stitched together into a single gateway schema.
It uses [`Schema Extensions`](/docs/approaches/schema-extensions) to add some local type definitions
and resolvers.

**This example demonstrates:**

- Adding a remote service that takes a file upload and saves on the disk. It shows how to forwards
  file uploads to the services through the gateway
- Adding a remote service that takes an image as a file upload and resizes it by using
  [sharp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sharp) and returns a base64 string representation of the
  resized image.
- It uses
  [File Upload recipe of GraphQL Yoga](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/yoga-server/docs/features/file-uploads)

The following services are available for interactive queries:

- **Stitched gateway:** listening on 4000/graphql
- Upload Files subservice\_: listening on 4001/graphql
- Resize Images subservice\_: listening on 4002/graphql

## Summary

Visit the stitched gateway and try running the following query:

```graphql
query {
  readFile(name: "yoga.png") {
    name
    type
    resizedBase64(width: 720, height: 405)
  }
}
```

In this example query, `readFile` of **Upload Files** subservice is called to read the file from the
disk and `resizedBase64` of **Resize Images** subservice is called to resize the image. In our
additional resolver we take `base64` representation of the file from the **Upload Files** subservice
and pass it to the **Resize Images** subservice like below;

> Created `file` object is passed to **Resize Images** as a file upload under the hood;

```ts
    resolvers: {
      FileEntry: {
        resizedBase64: {
          // We ask required fields to create a `File` instance
          selectionSet: `{ name type base64 }`,
          resolve(
            { name, type, base64 }: { name: string; type: string; base64: string },
            { width, height },
            context,
            info
          ) {
            if (!type.startsWith('image/')) {
                throw new GraphQLError('File is not an image');
            }
            const buffer = Buffer.from(base64, 'base64');
            const file = new File([buffer], name, { type });
            return delegateToSchema({
              schema: resizeImagesSubschema,
              fieldName: 'resizeImage',
              args: {
                file,
                width,
                height,
              },
              context,
              info,
            });
          },
        },
      },
    },
```

## Upload a File from the gateway

Run the following command from the terminal to upload the file `file.txt`. To learn more, visit
[graphql-multipart-request-spec](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec)

```bash
curl localhost:4000/graphql \
  -F operations='{ "query": "mutation($file: File!) { uploadFile(input: $file) { name type text } }", "variables": { "file": null } }' \
  -F map='{ "0": ["variables.file"] }' \
  -F 0=@graphql-upload/file.txt

# output
# {"data":{"uploadFile":{"filename":"file.txt","mimetype":"text/plain","text":"test file but not image\n"}}}
```
