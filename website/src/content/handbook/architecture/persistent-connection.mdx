# Persistent connection via WebSockets

This example demonstrates how to use
[GraphQL over WebSocket Protocol](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md)
to establish a persistent connection between services and a gateway. So the connection between the
gateway and the service not only exists during the request-response cycle, but also during the
entire lifetime of the gateway.

## Summary

When you start the gateway, it starts WebSockets connections for each service through WebSockets
executor;

```ts
const productsExec = buildGraphQLWSExecutor({
  url: 'ws://localhost:4001/graphql',
  lazy: true,
  lazyCloseTimeout: 10_000,
  onClient
})
```

And after that it keeps that open for the next 10 seconds defined with `lazyCloseTimeout`. You can
keep them open forever by removing that parameter and setting `lazy` to `false` but we prefer to
allow the upstream services rest if the gateway is not busy in a certain time.

The main point is to avoid the overhead of establishing a new connection for each request. This
shows WebSockets protocol is not only useful for subscriptions but also for regular queries and
mutations if you have a high traffic in your gateway.
